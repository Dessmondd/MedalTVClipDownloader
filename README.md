Download videos from Medal.TV without watermark.

This code is made for the purpose of being able to download videos without the watermark.

Code would be improved at some point specially for larger videos since it takes a little bit to download and it could be more efficient, but for overall length (20-25 secs clips) does the job.
If it freezes, most likely is because is fetching/downloading the video, so do not close it.

If there's any improvements or features you would like to suggest contact me! :)
